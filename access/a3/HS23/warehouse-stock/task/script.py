# The following code is just here as an example for you to try your

# However, make sure it doesn't break your solution when submitting.

#warehouse = { "A": 10, "B": 15, "C": 1, "D": 2 }
#add_stock(warehouse, "A")    # stock for A should now be 11
#remove_stock(warehouse, "D") # stock for D should now be 1
#remove_stock(warehouse, "C") # The key/value pair for key "C" should be removed
#remove_stock(warehouse, "X") # should print: X not in stock
#get_stock(warehouse, "B")    # should return 15
#get_stock(warehouse, "C")    # should return 0
#print(warehouse)             # to see if it worked
