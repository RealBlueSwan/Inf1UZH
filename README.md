## Lectures
Some of the lecture slides or jupyther follow along tutorials that our professor provided. 

## Mock Exam
There is a mock exam on the 04.11.2024 that is like a preparation for the final exam. It includes questions similar to those that may appear on the actual exam.

## Final Exam Questions
Some of the questions from the exam in HS23 to give you an idea of what to expect and to help you practice.

## Bottom line
Some Access exercises may change over time, I try to update the collection. I do not own any of the lecture slides and exerciese raws, I do not take credit for the hard work and effort that was put in these files. If you have new files or suggestions let me know.
