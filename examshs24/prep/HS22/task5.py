"""
Implement a class Currency, which takes three parameters in its constructor:

name, then name of the currency
amount, the amount of currency represented
rate, a conversion rate representing the value of one unit of this currency relative to a gold standard
These three values should be stored as instance attributes.

The Currency class should implement the equality operator as follows. Two instances of Currency are equal if multiplying the amount with the rate results in the same value for both instances. Considering the first example below, 15 EUR are equal to 10 GBP because 15 * 0.5 equals 10 * 0.75. Do not forget to correctly handle cases where the value being compared to is not an instance of Currency.

You may assume that Currency will only be constructed with parameters that match the description.

Use the following template:
"""

class Currency:
    def __init__(self, name, amount, rate):
        self.name = name
        self.amount = amount
        self.rate = rate


    def __eq__(self, other):
        # if multiplying the amount with the rate results in the same value for both instances. 
        # Considering the first example below, 15 EUR are equal to 10 GBP because 15 * 0.5 equals 10 * 0.75. 
        # Do not forget to correctly handle cases where the value being compared to is not an instance of Currency.
        if not isinstance(other, Currency):
            return NotImplemented
        
        return self.amount * self.rate == other.amount * other.rate


print( Currency("EUR", 15, 0.5) == Currency("GBP", 10, 0.75) )
print( Currency("EUR", 15, 0.5) != Currency("GBP", 15, 0.75) )
print( Currency("GBP", 1, 0.75) == Currency("GBP", 10, 0.75) )
print( Currency("CHF", 1.50, 0.78) == "Enough to buy a coffee" )
