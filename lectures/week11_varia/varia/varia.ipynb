So this test will **pass** even for a buggy implementation that does not check if each row has the same length! \n",

    " * The `with ... as ...:` statement is called a *context manager*. It ensures that when the `with` block ends, the file is properly closed. There are other context managers in Python, but for now, you only need to know this one for reading and writing files.\n",
    " * When reading or writing binary data, you may need to use the `\"wb\"`, `\"ab\"` and `\"rb\"` modes. We did not really discuss binary data. Just be aware of this.\n",
    " * Above, we used `f.read()` to read the entire file content and then we split it. You could also use `f.readlines()` or `list(f)` to obtain the lines directly.\n",
    " * If you have a very large file, reading all of it at once may not be possible. You can use `f.readline()` to read just one line or `f.read(n)` to read `n` characters (or bytes when in binary mode). You can also move to a different position in the file using `f.seek(...)`.\n",
    " * Python ships with many libraries to work with specific file types, such as [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) [ZIP files](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) or other archives, [emails](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html), [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), [HTML](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html#module-html.parser), [XML](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html), [SQLite databases](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html), and many more.

    "* If a class inherits from multiple classes which provide attribute with the same name, the first-imported one will be used\n",
    "* To access other super-implementations with the same name, explicitely naming the superclass is necessary\n",
