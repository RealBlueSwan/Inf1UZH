    "# The Building Blocks of Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the weeds of how to program in Python, specifically, let's get our bearings. For the purpose of this entry-level course, it's not wrong to say that programming is essentially made up of three main aspects: syntax, data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax specifies how you must formulate your program. It specifies rules on what each character means in which context. Different programming languages use different syntax. For example, `1 + 1` is syntactically correct, while `1 plus 1` is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn the Python syntax step by step as you learn new concepts and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can go into a program; data is stored and modified while a program is running, and data can be written out when a program is finished. Data can come in a variety of shapes and sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Simple data, such as numbers and characters: `0`, `1`, `0.5`, `True`, `False`, `\"H\"`\n",
    " * Basic data structures, such as strings: `\"Hello\"`, lists: `[1,2,\"Hello\"]`, maps (dictionaries): `{\"Police\": 117, \"Ambulance\": 144, \"Firefighters\": 118}` or sets: `{\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"}`\n",
    " * Complex data types (classes and objects) which can represent specific things: `c = Car(\"Ford\", \"Focus\", 1994); c.honk()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior determines what the program actually does. As a programmer, you can influence the behavior of the program in any number of ways:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Functions, like in maths, take parameters as input and produce results a.k.a. \"return values\" as output.\n",
    " * Control flow steers behavior based on conditions\n",
    " * Abstractions & Polymorphism: separating abstract behavior (e.g., \"transport\") from concrete behavior (e.g., \"by train\", \"on foot\", etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will learn most of Python's syntax, different ways of representing data, and some techniques to define behavior. However, we will really only scratch the surface of what's possible."
